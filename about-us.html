              The Origin of the Depot Dog
            </h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Home Depot began selling hot dogs in their stores as a part of their customer service offerings, often setting up hot dog stands or grills near the entrance or in the parking lot. This practice started in the early 1990s. The idea was to provide a convenient and affordable food option for customers who might be hungry while shopping or after completing their home improvement projects. Hot dogs became a popular snack choice for shoppers at Home Depot, and it's a tradition that continues in many of their stores across the United States.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
